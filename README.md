-----------------------
      The project was consisting of a lambda function to be invoked when an event or item is available or put 
      into the DynamoDB stream and this event data will be processed accordingly. 
      
      Then we wrote JUnit tests to test this lambda function by mocking all its relations or dependencies using Mockito tool ( The DynamoDB
      event in this scenario) and tested whether the lambda function is processing the information as required!
